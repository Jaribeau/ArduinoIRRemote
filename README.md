Welcome to Team Blonde's (aka Jared, Ana, and Andrew) SYDE 192L final project!

This project is essentially an IR remote - one arduino serving on the blaster side with some buttons and
an IR blaster - another Arduino serving as the receiver, running an IR receiver and a collection of LEDs.

To be continued...
